The following is how card numbers from the ESA database are decrypted:

1. ESA supplied a dll(PCI_utilities.dll) to be used to do decryption
2. We wrapped the dll in an exe (DecryptUtil.exe), to be called by the import process


Using DecryptUtil.exe:

1. App takes a filename as an argument. The file passed in should be a text file that contains encrypted card pans(line by line)
2. The app will read all lines (encrypted card numbers) into memory and process them one by one
3. In processing each line, the app calls the Decrypt function on PCI_utilities.dll.
4. The drypted card numbers are conveyed back to the import service using text files. The app creates a text file for each line.

Processing the card numbers:

1. The import service looks for the decrypted cards by lloking for a text file with a particular name.
